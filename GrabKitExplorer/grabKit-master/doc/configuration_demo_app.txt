To run GrabKit's demo application, you have first to download and install the specific libraries for each service.

There are 2 single steps :
 * download and install Facebook SDK
 * download and install the other libraries


### Download and install Facebook SDK


FacebookSDK 3.2 is the last version tested and used with GrabKit. You can download it here :

https://developers.facebook.com/resources/facebook-ios-sdk-3.2.pkg


( You can find other versions here http://developers.facebook.com/ios/downloads/ but the only version GrabKit v1.3 has been tested with is the 3.2 )


The default install location is ~/Documents/FacebookSDK


Add Facebook SDK to the demo application by dragging the FacebookSDK.framework folder from the SDK installation folder into the Frameworks section of the demo application.

Add the FacebookSDK to both GrabKitDemo target and GrabKitLib Target

Add the Facebook SDK for iOS resource bundle by dragging the FacebookSDKResources.bundle file from the FacebookSDK.framework/Resources folder into the Frameworks section of your Project Navigator.

Add the FacebookSDK to both GrabKitDemo target and GrabKitBundle Target

Unfold the Resources section, and remove the reference to the plist file. This file is known to mess with the plist project and prevent the demo app from compiling.

GrabKit's demo application is already configured with a default Facebook App Id.





###  Download and install the other libraries

This step will make you install GrabKit's submodules.

If you cloned GrabKit with the method "git clone", you can install them by using submodules methods. In a console, at the root of your project, enter :

	#refer to http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules
 
	git submodule init
 
	git submodule update


This step is optionnal, and doesn't make you install all the libraries needed. Proceed with the following step also :



Run the bash script grabKit/GrabKit/submodules/installSubmodules.sh

Ensure that you have the write permision in this directory.


This script will download the dependancies from GitHub, then unzip and install them. 

They will be ignored if they already exist (i.e. if you used submodules)

It will also import specific files from Google's svn repositories.



Have a look to GrabKit's project, and unfold the grabKit/submodules group : Files must have turned from red to black, and the demo application should compile.

The "grabKitDemo" target should now compile and run properly.


You can now [install GrabKit in your own application](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/wiki/How-to-install-GrabKit)
