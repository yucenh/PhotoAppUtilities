This page will guide you to configure GrabKit for your app.


# Prerequisites


First, be sure you have [followed the instructions](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/wiki/How-to-run-GrabKit's-demo-application)  to run GrabKit's demo application. 

Be also sure you have [followed the instructions](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit/wiki/How-to-install-GrabKit)  to install GrabKit in your own application. 


# Configuration


In order to grab content from each service, you need to register your app and get an API key from each service. 

Here are the detailed instructions for each service.


#### Facebook :
* go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/ and click on "+ Create new app"
* enter a name for your app, and proceed
* Once you have completed the process, you'll access the page of your app.
  It shows an App Id : that's what we need.

* Open your application's App-Info.plist and in "URL Types" -> "item N" -> "URL Schemes", add "fb" + your App Id (like "fb350975928312519" for example)
* Still in the App-Info.plist file, add an entry with the key "FacebookAppID", and your App Id as value (like "350975928312519" for example)
* Report your App Id into your configurator file, in the method facebookAppId
    
( You can find more informations about configuring your application with Facebook SDK here : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/facebook-sdk-for-ios/3.1/  )

#### Instagram :
* go to http://instagram.com/developer/clients/register/
* fill the form. In the "OAuth redirect_uri" field, enter a lowercase url like "mygreatapplication://". 
* Report your Client ID and your Redirect URI  into your configurator file, respectively in the methods instagramAppId and instagramRedirectUri
* Open your application's App-Info.plist and in "URL Types" -> "item N" -> "URL Schemes", add your redirect URI (without the "://")

    
#### FlickR :
* go to http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/ and choose the kind of key you want (Commercial or non-commercial)
* Process the form and report your Api Key and your Api Secret into your configurator file, in the methods flickrApiKey and flickrApiSecret.
* Click on "Edit auth flow for this app", 
    * in App type, select "web application" (yes, web application ;))
    * in Callback URL, add a custom and unique url, like "mygreatappusinggrabkit://" or "flickr"+your app id+"://"
    Report your callback url into your configurator file in the method flickrRedirectUri
	* Open your application's App-Info.plist and in "URL Types" -> "item N" -> "URL Schemes", add your redirect URI (without the "://")
        
    

#### Picasa : 
* go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/   
    If you have never used Google APIs console before, click on "Create project".
    A default project named "API Project" is created

* Select your project, go to the "API Access" item, and click on "Create an OAUth 2.0 client ID ..."
* Enter your application's name and other informations if you need
* in Application type, select "Installed application"
* in "Installed application type", select "other" (don't select "iOS", it's buggy ...)
