/* The Picasa connector doesn't open a Safari page to let the user authenticate. Instead, it presents a viewController.
 When using the GrabKitPicker, the viewController is presented in its navigation hierarchy, there is nothing you have to handle.
 
 But when you use GrabKit as a library, Picasa's Auth viewController needs to be displayed.
 The viewController returned by this configuration method will present Picasa's auth controller.
 
 
 If your custom viewController is an instance of UINavigationController, GrabKit will call the configuration method 'customViewControllerShouldPresentPicasaAuthControllerModally' to know if Picasa's Auth Controller must be presented "modally", or pushed in the navigation hierarchy.
 
 If your custom viewController is not a navigationController, GrabKit will present Picasa's auth controller "modally"
